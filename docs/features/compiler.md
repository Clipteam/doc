The compiler is a new way to run your project, converting your blocks into native JavaScript code to dramatically improve runtime efficiency.

2. Click 'Settings'
3. Find 'Player' -> 'Compiler', and set it.
4. Enjoy!

## Tips
1. With the compiler enabled, you may not be able to preview your changes in real time during runtime.
2. Compiler features are still in a very early stage of development, and it is to be expected that there are a lot of issues that need to be fixed at this time. We do not recommend using this feature while running your project at this time. You can try [Turbowarp](https://turbowarp.org/).
