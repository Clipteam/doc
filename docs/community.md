ClipCommunity is a Online programming platform that uses ClipCC as default editor. There are many differences between the community version of ClipCC and the standalone version.
1. Community Edition supports unique content related to the community (e.g. version history back, cloud variables, usernames, etc.)
2. The Community Edition does not support loading extensions by upload. All extensions are reviewed and published by Clipteam to ensure security. You can contact us to publish your extensions.
3. The community version will not be open source due to security reasons.
